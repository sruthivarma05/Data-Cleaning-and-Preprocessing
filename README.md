# Data-Cleaning-and-Preprocessing
In this code, I worked on cleaning and preparing the Netflix dataset for analysis. I started by dealing with missing values: for the columns director, cast, and country I replaced the blanks with “Unknown,” for date_added I used a default date of “01-01-2000,” and for rating I filled in the missing entries with the most common value in that column. Since only a few rows were missing duration, I decided to drop them. After that, I removed any duplicate rows to keep the dataset consistent.

I also standardized the text values to make the data more uniform. The type column was converted to lowercase, while title, director, cast, and country were converted into title case. The rating column was transformed into uppercase. For dates, I converted the date_added column into a proper datetime format and reformatted it to show in the dd-mm-yyyy style. I also cleaned the column names by making them lowercase and replacing spaces or hyphens with underscores so they would be easier to work with in code.

Finally, I checked and corrected the data types, making sure that date_added was properly stored as datetime. To confirm everything was in order, I printed out the number of missing values, the number of duplicates, the data types of each column, and previewed the first ten rows of the cleaned dataset.
